# Trail Guide

![alt text](https://github.com/dalewb/trail_guide_front_end/blob/master/images/app_image.png)

A guide for long distance hikers to plan mulit-day hikes.  Hikers are able to find new locations with descriptions, find items that they need to purchase, obtain or use, or create new items and services necessary to facilitate a fun filled adventure.  I came up with the idea to work on this app because I had hiked the Appalachian Trail and I thought it would be helpful to have an app where you could search different locations, determine when you would reach it and then add necessary items to that location in order to better plan your trip.  

Users can start by searching hiking and camping locations throughout the entire US.  This search is done using the [TrailMaze API](https://market.mashape.com/trailapi/trailapi)
